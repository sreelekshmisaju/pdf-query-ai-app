#  AI PDF Content Query App

A robust, offline-capable application for extracting and querying content from PDF documents using AI. Built with Streamlit and Hugging Face Transformers (DistilBERT), this tool allows users to upload academic or technical PDFs and ask contextual questions in natural language. No OpenAI or external API key required.

---

##  Project Objectives

- Extract structured text from academic or scanned PDFs.
- Enable users to ask multiple questions about the content.
- Maintain per-session Q&A history and downloadable responses.
- Provide an intuitive, theme-enabled, responsive UI.
- Ensure offline/local operation using Hugging Face models.

---

##  Methodology

This app uses:
- `PyMuPDF (fitz)` to extract per-page text from PDFs.
- Hugging Face Transformers (`distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`) to answer user queries.
- Streamlit for an interactive web interface.
- Optional logging for tracking all LLM interactions.

The input PDF is processed on upload, and extracted text is passed to the QA model. User questions are run against this context and answers are displayed with a download option and session history.

##  LLM Interaction Logging

All user questions and generated answers are saved in:

```
logs/llm_logs.txt
```

Example:

```
Q: What is the main objective of the document?
A: To analyze the impact of digital finance in Indian villages.

Q: Who authored this document?
A: Ministry of Rural Development.
```

##  Example Usage

##  Live Deployment Link : https://pdf-query-ai-app-gappuf6u4gxrkrmgmqjuay.streamlit.app/

## Demo Video : 


**Step-by-step**:

1. Upload a report or thesis PDF
2. Ask: "What is the summary of this paper?"
3. Ask follow-ups like:

   * "Who are the authors?"
   * "What are the conclusions?"
4. Download the latest answer

##  Troubleshooting

| Issue                                | Solution                                                |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `No module named 'fitz'`             | Run `pip install PyMuPDF`                               |
| Hugging Face model not loading       | Check your internet connection for model download       |
| Streamlit crashes with long PDF text | Limit `all_text[:3000]` or split content using chunks   |
| App UI broken on mobile              | Use full-screen view or increase layout width in config |

---

##  Theme Customization

Edit `.streamlit/config.toml`:

```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#4B8BBE"
backgroundColor = "#ffffff"
textColor = "#262730"
font = "sans serif"
```

Or toggle Dark Mode within the sidebar.

---

##  Future Roadmap

*  Semantic search with vector embeddings
*  Upgrade to multilingual QA models
*  Export full Q\&A sessions to PDF
*  Multi-document Q\&A with ranking
*  Option to run model via API if needed
